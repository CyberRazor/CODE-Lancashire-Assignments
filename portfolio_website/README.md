This is my web development coursework. It is designed as a portfolio page for my audio career - showings my achievements and additional skills.

Using JavaScript, Tailwind, HTML, CSS and React I have incorporated React Routing, several interactive elements and a data collection form.




# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
